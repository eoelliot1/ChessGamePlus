## This is a project that takes the original game of chess and adds on new additional features to revolutionise the way you can play chess. This includes new chess sets that introduce unique units with completely new functionality, design, and gameplay strategies, as well as digital interfaces that enhance gameplay. These innovations aim to make chess more engaging and accessible to a broader audience with new units.

## Key Features
1. New Units.
2. Digital interface gameplay.
3. Pixel art designs for both classical and new chess units.
4. All the features of orriginal chess.

## Current sets
1. CLASSIC: This is the Classical chess set, with all its corresponding rules like promotions, en passant, etc.
Units: 
Pawn - Classical Pawn rules.

Rook - Classical Rook rules.

Knight - Classical Knight rules.

Bishop - Classical Bishop rules.

Queen - Classical Queen rules.

King - Classical King rules.

2. Coven(W.I.P): A chess set that allows you to maniuplate the board with infecting, self-destructing, summoning, reviving fallen units, and a depleting life-system. 
Units:
Zombie - Functions like a classical Pawn unit, but will infect other units into Zombies instead of attacking them.

Skeleton - Fast-moving units that can be summoned by the Necromancer, and self-destruct whenever they attack.

Dullahan(W.I.P Concept) - A unit that functions similar to Knights, enabling them to also jump over units.

Necromancer - Every 6th turn, if there is space, the Necromancer commences summoning, choosing to summon either a Skeleton or a Zombie. If there is no Lich King on the board, then the Necromancer will revive the Lich King.

Lich King - Moves like the classical King in chess but cannot be put in check. If this unit is eliminated, then every turn played without the Lich King will deplete your number of lives. If the number of lives reaches 0, then you lose. This unit can be resummoned back into the board with a Necromancer.
